# Web Native Card/Deck Simulation

Currently focusing on tarot deck semantics and SVG graphics.

Written in type-annotated proper JavaScript.

No framework(s).

No dependencies.

No build process.

For development/demo, just start your preferred static http server:
- easy mode managed by this project: `yarn install && npm run start`
- but you could just as easily `python -m http.server`
  
See [dev.md](dev.md) for musings on what it all means, and where it might go.
