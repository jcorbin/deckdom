# Hello There...

Beware, this is an early demo:

1. The purple area on the right is called *the library*
2. Click a deck button to it; this readme is also notionally in *the library*
3. Library buttons that represent card decks may be drug onto *the table*; that is, the main dark area beside the library.
4. Card and stack interaction on the table is rudimentary at present:
  - start dragging a stack, but the drag only really *starts* once you mouse cursor *exits* a card or stack
  - dragging from a stack cuts it: you take a number of cards proportional to the cursor Y value when it exited the stack
  - dropping onto a stack places onto / under / cut-into it: depending again on the mouse cursor Y value when the drop finishes
  - left click to turn a card over
  - right click to reverse a stack of cards

So at present, the only way to shuffle goes like this:
1. drag a deck to the table to instantiate a deck
2. drag-drop it any number of times to create 2 or more cut stacks
3. maybe right click one of them to introduce reversals
4. drop-drop back and forth between these stacks some number of times; maybe also mix in right clicks to reverse stacks
5. finally combine all the stack back into one: as you'll learn above, drag from the *bottom* of a stack to take the whole thing

To pull a single card from a stack, simply drag from the *top* of its box.
These *top* and *bottom* regions are 20% of the card's vertical space,
leaving the inner 60% to define a cut point.

**NOTE:** firefox users may hold <cite>Shift</cite> for native context menu

# TODO

Primary is to complete and improve card/stack UX:
- revamp the current janky drag-drop affair until it works better
- allow cards to be manipulated much more naturally
- add more shuffling modes, particularly "riffle together 2 stacks" and "let RNG take the wheel"
- after we get it working well on desktop, mobile/tablet touch is a primary concern

Secondary is places on the table, and fancy table art like backdrops, spreads, etc:
- defining a *place* will be a fundamental action; i.e. tap a card and say
  - e.g. "this stack is the discard pile"
  - e.g. "this card represents the Past, this one the Present, this one the Future"
- places will persist even after any cards there are removed, and will serve as a UX anchor for "maybe put card(s) here"
- of primary import will be supporting crossed placement as seen frequently in tarot spreads

Tertiary are *Hands*, as in you've got 2 of them for holding cards off the table.
Should be able to do things like fan held cards, manipulated held stack,
pick more up, put some down, etc.
An eventual stretch dream here may be 3d manipulation of a stack,
but that's probably difficult to get a natural UX for without a VR controller of 6dof mouse.

Along the way, we need moar decks, the ability to edit deck interactively,
import deck assets, export decks, and so on.

## WIP

## TODO

- revamp drag/drop semantics
  - maybe should mostly move all by default, require drag on edge/border to cut stack?
  - improve drag pre-take feedback: an overlay and/or just start taking on
    mousedown, only finalizing take stack on first leave

- reprise stack abstraction ; rework how cards work
  - what if cards were literal child elements, rather than json data array
  - allow mismatched bounding boxes
  - allow 2.5d not-quite fan spread, maybe base cut ui off this instead of simulating it with Y range mapping

- reprise [Archived TODO state] content after we get through above rework

## Done

- cleaned up index dev log integration, made the readme dialog auto-show only
  once-per-content-hash, as a good excuse to start a small storage module
- dumping links from browser tabs
  <https://css-pattern.com/>
  <https://css-tricks.com/hexagons-and-beyond-flexible-responsive-grid-patterns-sans-media-queries/>
  <https://thefoolstarot.com/gallery/>
  <https://github.com/lawreka/ascii-tarot>

# 2025-04-02

- switched github pages deploy to main branch, keeping less held back in dev branch
- reworked readme dialog, integrating it directly with this dev log
- fixed chrome
  - turns out that chrome disallows `html` content inside an `svg metadata` even if you use `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"`
  - its failure mode is to hoist what should be `svg metadata ...` child nodes up several levels in the containing DOM
  - but it doesn't stop there, it also hoists all subsequent `svg` elements, like the `defs`, which cause an explosion of surprise content
  - it's like the html parser is bailing on "this is svg content" and breaking back out to sibling space
  - may be avoidable if we can shift to some kind of more DOM native SVG/XML tree grating, rather than `innerHTML` splatting

# 2025-04-01

- got deck viewer hooked back up, ready to edit; also it's now a proper `<dialog>`
- added hash var state handling so that deck editor dialog state can easily persist
- pushed dev branch to gh-pages
  - BUG: doesn't work in chrome, let alone mobile

# 2025-03-31

- revamped toplevel surface:
  - decks are now discovered by link/a-tag search
  - add an optional toplevel library element, where deck are loaded
  - the library may be, recommended to be, a list element; dl, menu, ol, or ul at present
  - deck load failure feedback can then be naturally shown in the library
  - decks can be dragged from library to table to instantiate a card stack

# 2025-03-30

- revamped card and deck data type definitions and especially deck definition/loading
  - card data type is now independent of document representation form
  - deck data type is now first class, and implementation hides document representation
  - provide deck title, name, metadata ; now used in the book viewer
- updated alleged convert utility to include fixup transforms, and drop the
  json index in lieu of svg native data annotations, metadata, and id reference

# 2025-03-29

- got book viewer index navigation working

# 2025-03-28

- minor work on book viewer, didn't quite get getting loop working yet

# 2025-03-27

- fixed initial run of alleged tarot conversion
- support loading spec from external file
- reworked card book viewer to be continuous scroll
- limited controller event handling to only withing domain elements

# 2025-03-26

- added an alleged tarot conversion utility
- improved card book viewer
  - simplified and mad selection logic/ux more robust
  - decoupled internal card display from defined/id-entifed cards,
    a nod to a potential future card editor UI

# 2025-03-25

- simplified card data string to include orientation without JSON: `3#id` is 3 z-flips, `3,1#id` is a reversed face-up card
- converted alleged fool ; time mostly spent re-ramping up on how svg works
- built out card face rendering routine, just svg for now
- fixed event handling over child svg elements
- converted alleged magician ; added modal for card book browsing

# 2025-03-24

- got drag-to-cut and drop-to-stack working!
- also with a basic click to flip top card for now

# 2025-03-23

- continued developing drag start/enter/update logic
  - found out that drag data transfer cannot be updated during enter event
  - probably only valid during start event
- so need to lower back to mouse events after all
- got minimal stack cutting drag/drop operation working

# 2025-03-22

- mostly an offline day musing on where to go next
- post hoc wrote below notes from yesterday, then continued here
- realized may be able to create a card element immediately on drag start
  - use it to draw the drag image, same way the dropped stack/card will look
  - not sure if can get away with orphaned node, or if will need to be in-document, but invisible? display-none?
  - at any rate, should try to avoid bespoke canvas drawing, offscreen or otherwise
- realized that drag Y remapping has interesting next steps:
  - do a similar for click zones, drop zones, etc, which probably evolves to XY vec2 remapping
  - visualize with canvas-drawn overlay, starting on hover-dwell, evolving on `dragstart`
  - can also participate in touch events like `touchstart` / etc
  - the "dead" end zones may nicely afford corner or edge action zones, esp for hover/click interactions
    - might end up feeling like a card-natural analog of a pie menu
    - may adapt well to tap-for-actions modality

# 2025-03-21

- pivoted prototype mouse handling code to drag event handling;
  unsure how far this will work, but it seems promising:
  - `dragstart` picks up 1 or more cards
  - amount picked varies based on Y location the drag starts on card 
  - plan to vary amount being picked based on subsequent `dragover` events
  - plan to base `click` events to quickly pickup 1 / arbitrary N / all on same Y mapping
  - plan to add some kind of overlay to show these zones, at least during drag, maybe also in help screen, maybe just proactively on hover-dwell
- just got the drag behavior done, no dropping yet
- also plan to further elaborate the drag image for feedback on how much is being picked
- immediately moving card data from target element dataset to drag event data transfer is neat

# 2025-03-20

- started dev log, musing on (inter)action space

<https://alleged.org.uk/pdc/tarot/about.html>

> Some while back I produced a minicomic called the Pebble Tarot,
> depicting the major arcana of the traditional Tarot deck in stick-figure form.
> In January 2002, I started a project to produce a new version of the stick-figure tarot,
> this time drawing them in colour and publishing them in SVG format.
> 
> I hope Tarot aficionados will not be too offended by my frivolous stick-figure interpretation.
> I figure that Tarot illustrations are supposed to be symbolic,
> and thereâ€™s nothing more symbolic than a stick figure.
> I have done a modicum of research this time around,
> and have included some of the symbolism from mediaeval and modern decks.

<https://www.innerworldtarot.co.nz/about-this-deck/>
> The Inner World Tarot has been available as a free download since about 1997. It is a complete, 78 card deck with illustrated Minor and Major Arcana cards.
> 
> A good bit of the symbolism comes from Paul Foster Case's "Builders of the Adytum" deck, Crowley's Thoth deck and of course, the perennial Ryder Waite deck illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith. The titles on the cards come from the Thoth deck, and I don't know where I got the idea of adding the astrological information for each card. I'm pretty sure that the idea of referring to each card as "the Lord" of this that and the other comes from Eily Peach's "Tarot Workbook" and Case's book.
> 
> I came up with many original designs, however. The original idea was to have a deck made entirely of photographs, perhaps using Polaroids, but they proved impossibly fragile when it came to shuffling a few of them, let alone 78. I have no idea who many of the people in the photographs are. Some were friends who I met online, some were complete strangers that passed by wherever I was on the net and disappeared forever.
> 
> The deck was originally hosted on a free Tripod site (where you can still find it) but in the end there were way too many ads and popups and I didn't want to subject visitors to all that. So I moved everything to a free Geocities site and, now that Geocities is shutting down, I have finally decided to put the deck on its own dedicated website.
> 
> To be honest, I had almost forgotten about this deck (and the many gaps in the manual) until a few weeks ago when I received an email from somebody that wanted to download the deck for use in some sort of software. And seeing that people were still downloading the deck, I felt a bit ashamed at having been so lazy and have decided to finish the manual for once and for all.
> 
> The only other changes have been that the copyright notice on each card, which used to read "Riobravo Technologies Ltd" (which was an actual company) has been changed to "Vince Cabrera". The .BMP format which the cards originally came in has also been changed to .PNG for faster loading.

    - for mouse interaction, clicking a hand could select it as the mouse hand?
    - for touch, tapping a hand could toggle primacy?
  - [ ] how does drag start evolve when hand not empty?
    - hand starts empty
    - ... pickup 3 cards: hand now holds a 3-stack, oriented however was
    - ... pickup 2 cards: hand now holds a 2-stack and a 3-stack, rendered as a slight radial fan
    - ... pickup 1 card: hand now holds a car and a 5-stack, rendered as a slight 2-element fan ; the prior 2/3 fan was auto collapsed
    - i.e. force user to fan out hand if that's what they want, but auto collapse on subsequent pickup
  - [ ] basic click events
  - [ ] touch events ; pointer events

# Design Muse

- "natural" user actions:
  - pickup 1 card ... N cards ... whole stack ; merges with any prior held card/stack
  - place 1 card ... N cards ... whole held stack
  - nominate place
    1. "this is the 'draw pile'"
    2. "this is the 'discard pile'"
    3. "this is the 'query'"
  - swap to off hand
  - rotate card or stack:
    - Z is free rotation, maybe snapped to 45 or 90 degree increments
    - X and Y are flips of the held card ...
    - ... maybe valid to flip a stack on edge tho, so 90 degree increments, but only when held, not when on table
  - riffle held stack to placed stack
  - riffle 2 held stacks
  - bridge held riffle
  - settle riffle
  - fan held stack
  - split held stack ( holding 2 stack, basically a gap pointer )
  - swap N cards into split gap
  - spread stack on table ; creates chain of cards?

- "artificial" user actions:
  - sort stack ; restore original order
  - RNG shuffle stack ; auto prng vs user entropy provided by wiggle/shake
  - gather all cards to nominated place
  - scatter all cards from stack across board ; avoid nominated places?
