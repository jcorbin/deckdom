## TODO

- actions:
  - pickup: left/right hand? how deep thru stack?
  - move -- how much of stack?
  - drop: how much of held stack?
  - slide card (off top of stack) -- is this just move with minimal take?
  - take-n-flip
  - smear stack -- move with variable decreasing take?
  - Y rotate (aka H flip): held or target
  - X rotate (aka V flip): held or target
  - Z rotate: held or target
  - cut stack - move with variable take suffices?
  - restack - move stack on top of other stack suffices?
  - shuffle: riffle 2 held stacks
  - split held stack ; inject from other held stack @ split

## WIP
