## Design Muse

- "natural" user actions:
  - pickup 1 card ... N cards ... whole stack ; merges with any prior held card/stack
  - place 1 card ... N cards ... whole held stack
  - nominate place
    1. "this is the 'draw pile'"
    2. "this is the 'discard pile'"
    3. "this is the 'query'"
  - swap to off hand
  - rotate card or stack:
    - Z is free rotation, maybe snapped to 45 or 90 degree increments
    - X and Y are flips of the held card ...
    - ... maybe valid to flip a stack on edge tho, so 90 degree increments, but only when held, not when on table
  - riffle held stack to placed stack
  - riffle 2 held stacks
  - bridge held riffle
  - settle riffle
  - fan held stack
  - split held stack ( holding 2 stack, basically a gap pointer )
  - swap N cards into split gap
  - spread stack on table ; creates chain of cards?

- "artificial" user actions:
  - sort stack ; restore original order
  - RNG shuffle stack ; auto prng vs user entropy provided by wiggle/shake
  - gather all cards to nominated place
  - scatter all cards from stack across board ; avoid nominated places?

## TODO

- actions that should be possible:
  - [x] move card(s)
  - [~] take card(s)
  - [~] flip card
  - [ ] rotate card sideways ; also odd angles?
  - [ ] place card(s)
  - [ ] place part of stack
  - [~] cut stack ... short cut for take / place?
  - [ ] rotate held stack ; nominal reverse
  - [ ] RNG shuffle 1 stack
  - [ ] shuffle 2 stacks: riffle ; other methods?
  - [ ] nominate stack ; define place
  - [ ] place actions: gather all ; shuffle in place via RNG
  - [ ] fan stack in hand ; spread stack on table
  - [ ] ripple/wave flip spread stack
  - [ ] destructive gimmicks like shred/tear/burn
  - [ ] creative gimmicks like annotate / draw / text / tally
  - [ ] artifact gimmicks like counters, tokens, dice

- basic interaction
  - [x] drag start picks N based on card-offset cursor Y value, within a 60% inner active band
    - ... drag progression can then adjust N, finalizing amount when drag exits source element
  - [x] drop on domain seems straight forward
  - [ ] drop on extant stack, probably presents interaction zones
    - top: stack over
    - main: riffle with by swiping?
    - main: cut into by dwell (to settle/cancel riffle) then release?
    - bottom: stack under
  - [ ] play with secondary buttons clicks while dragging
  - [~] main hand / off hand is ( the only? an? ) initial place?
  - ... mh is bound to mouse events ; first touch point
  - ... oh responds to second touch point ; maybe mouse events initiated by secondary button? modifier key?
  - [ ] display left/right hand, make them drop zones?
    - for mouse interaction, clicking a hand could select it as the mouse hand?
    - for touch, tapping a hand could toggle primacy?
  - [ ] how does drag start evolve when hand not empty?
    - hand starts empty
    - ... pickup 3 cards: hand now holds a 3-stack, oriented however was
    - ... pickup 2 cards: hand now holds a 2-stack and a 3-stack, rendered as a slight radial fan
    - ... pickup 1 card: hand now holds a car and a 5-stack, rendered as a slight 2-element fan ; the prior 2/3 fan was auto collapsed
    - i.e. force user to fan out hand if that's what they want, but auto collapse on subsequent pickup
  - [ ] basic click events
  - [ ] touch events ; pointer events

- maybe drag should mostly move all by default, require drag on edge/border to cut stack?

- improve drag pre-take feedback: an overlay and/or just start taking on
  mousedown, only finalizing take stack on first leave

## WIP

- acquire tarot asset set:
  - [x] alleged deck conversion
  - [x] use of external svg asset
  - [x] alleged quality check - g2g but for label placement
  - [ ] deck editing to fix alleged label placement
  - [ ] svg playing cards
  - [ ] colman-smith raster images
  - [ ] ascii-tarot
- toplevel api iteration
  - [ ] pass multiple decks
  - [ ] pass or spec more domains
  - [ ] show library
  - [ ] show books
  - [ ] action/drag to instantiate book

## Done

- got book viewer index navigation working

# 2025-03-28

- minor work on book viewer, didn't quite get getting loop working yet

# 2025-03-27

- fixed initial run of alleged tarot conversion
- support loading spec from external file
- reworked card book viewer to be continuous scroll
- limited controller event handling to only withing domain elements

# 2025-03-26

- added an alleged tarot conversion utility
- improved card book viewer
  - simplified and mad selection logic/ux more robust
  - decoupled internal card display from defined/id-entifed cards,
    a nod to a potential future card editor UI

# 2025-03-25

- simplified card data string to include orientation without JSON: `3#id` is 3 z-flips, `3,1#id` is a reversed face-up card
- converted alleged fool ; time mostly spent re-ramping up on how svg works
- built out card face rendering routine, just svg for now
- fixed event handling over child svg elements
- converted alleged magician ; added modal for card book browsing

# 2025-03-24

- got drag-to-cut and drop-to-stack working!
- also with a basic click to flip top card for now

# 2025-03-23

- continued developing drag start/enter/update logic
  - found out that drag data transfer cannot be updated during enter event
  - probably only valid during start event
- so need to lower back to mouse events after all
- got minimal stack cutting drag/drop operation working

# 2025-03-22

- mostly an offline day musing on where to go next
- post hoc wrote below notes from yesterday, then continued here
- realized may be able to create a card element immediately on drag start
  - use it to draw the drag image, same way the dropped stack/card will look
  - not sure if can get away with orphaned node, or if will need to be in-document, but invisible? display-none?
  - at any rate, should try to avoid bespoke canvas drawing, offscreen or otherwise
- realized that drag Y remapping has interesting next steps:
  - do a similar for click zones, drop zones, etc, which probably evolves to XY vec2 remapping
  - visualize with canvas-drawn overlay, starting on hover-dwell, evolving on `dragstart`
  - can also participate in touch events like `touchstart` / etc
  - the "dead" end zones may nicely afford corner or edge action zones, esp for hover/click interactions
    - might end up feeling like a card-natural analog of a pie menu
    - may adapt well to tap-for-actions modality

# 2025-03-21

- pivoted prototype mouse handling code to drag event handling;
  unsure how far this will work, but it seems promising:
  - `dragstart` picks up 1 or more cards
  - amount picked varies based on Y location the drag starts on card 
  - plan to vary amount being picked based on subsequent `dragover` events
  - plan to base `click` events to quickly pickup 1 / arbitrary N / all on same Y mapping
  - plan to add some kind of overlay to show these zones, at least during drag, maybe also in help screen, maybe just proactively on hover-dwell
- just got the drag behavior done, no dropping yet
- also plan to further elaborate the drag image for feedback on how much is being picked
- immediately moving card data from target element dataset to drag event data transfer is neat

# 2025-03-20

- started dev log, musing on (inter)action space

## Tarot Decks

Chased down some assets from <http://freeware.esoterica.free.fr/html/freecards.html>

### Alleged Tarot

<https://alleged.org.uk/pdc/tarot/svg.html>
<https://alleged.org.uk/pdc/tarot/about.html>

> Some while back I produced a minicomic called the Pebble Tarot,
> depicting the major arcana of the traditional Tarot deck in stick-figure form.
> In January 2002, I started a project to produce a new version of the stick-figure tarot,
> this time drawing them in colour and publishing them in SVG format.
> 
> I hope Tarot aficionados will not be too offended by my frivolous stick-figure interpretation.
> I figure that Tarot illustrations are supposed to be symbolic,
> and thereâ€™s nothing more symbolic than a stick figure.
> I have done a modicum of research this time around,
> and have included some of the symbolism from mediaeval and modern decks.

<https://www.innerworldtarot.co.nz/about-this-deck/>
> The Inner World Tarot has been available as a free download since about 1997. It is a complete, 78 card deck with illustrated Minor and Major Arcana cards.
> 
> A good bit of the symbolism comes from Paul Foster Case's "Builders of the Adytum" deck, Crowley's Thoth deck and of course, the perennial Ryder Waite deck illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith. The titles on the cards come from the Thoth deck, and I don't know where I got the idea of adding the astrological information for each card. I'm pretty sure that the idea of referring to each card as "the Lord" of this that and the other comes from Eily Peach's "Tarot Workbook" and Case's book.
> 
> I came up with many original designs, however. The original idea was to have a deck made entirely of photographs, perhaps using Polaroids, but they proved impossibly fragile when it came to shuffling a few of them, let alone 78. I have no idea who many of the people in the photographs are. Some were friends who I met online, some were complete strangers that passed by wherever I was on the net and disappeared forever.
> 
> The deck was originally hosted on a free Tripod site (where you can still find it) but in the end there were way too many ads and popups and I didn't want to subject visitors to all that. So I moved everything to a free Geocities site and, now that Geocities is shutting down, I have finally decided to put the deck on its own dedicated website.
> 
> To be honest, I had almost forgotten about this deck (and the many gaps in the manual) until a few weeks ago when I received an email from somebody that wanted to download the deck for use in some sort of software. And seeing that people were still downloading the deck, I felt a bit ashamed at having been so lazy and have decided to finish the manual for once and for all.
> 
> The only other changes have been that the copyright notice on each card, which used to read "Riobravo Technologies Ltd" (which was an actual company) has been changed to "Vince Cabrera". The .BMP format which the cards originally came in has also been changed to .PNG for faster loading.

### The 1910 Deck
